The kind of badge we are applying for is *Replicated*.

The reasons that we believe our artifact deserves this badge:
  1) We have open sourced the repository under the BSD-3 license.
  2) We provide detailed description and tutorial in the README page.
  3) Our code is documented and well-structured.
  4) The experiments in our paper can be easily rerun using the corresponding `main`
     functions in the `singularity.benchmarks` package.
