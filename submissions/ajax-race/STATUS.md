# Status

We believe that our artifact meets the criteria for a "reusable" artifact, since the artifact comes with:

* Extensive install instructions and a VM where everything has been prepared

* Instructions that detail the high-level steps that are carried out when running the tool, and which source files that are responsible for the individual steps

* Carefully documented source code

* An easy-to-use command-line script for running the tool that generates an extensive HTML-based report that visualizes the results of a run

* A large test suite of relevant test programs that can be used to test if the implementation has been installed properly, and are also useful to understand how AjaxRacer works on small examples

* A simple command-line script that can be used to run the experiments from the paper
