We are applying for the "Available" badge.

We believe our artifact (MT-ABC) deserves this because:

- artifact is well documented, structured, complete, and thoroughly tested
	* We ran our tool on over 30,000 different constraints of varying size and complexity (see paper for experiment information)
	* We attempted to follow Google C++ coding standards throughout the implementation; the directory structure follows the GNU Autotools guideline

- artifact is easy to use and integrate into existing projects as a library call, or as a stand-alone SMT model counter
	* Java programs can call MT-ABC through the Java Native Interface implementation we have provided (with an example in the Virtual Machine)

- artifact is placed on a publicly accessable archival repository
	* DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1297696
