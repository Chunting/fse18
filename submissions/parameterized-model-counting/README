Additionally, the source code is included in ABC-1.0.0.zip

Within the home directory is a script (run.sh) to run a few experiments and quickly show results, with an accompanying HOW_TO_RUN.txt

The Multi-Track Automata Based Counter (MT-ABC) is a string and numeric constriant solver and model counter. ABC provides solutions to systems of string and numeric constraints in the form of a multi-tracked deterministic finite automaton. In addition ABC produces symbolic representation of the number of strings and integers within a length bound, k, that satisfy a set of constraints. ABC can also output the number of satisfying solutions given a bound.
