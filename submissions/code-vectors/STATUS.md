We are applying for the 'Available' badge.

We have documented our artifacts in a consistent and complete manner. These artifacts use standard software (Docker / Unix Makefiles / bash scripts) to facilitate easy installation of our various tools and datasets.

Furthermore, aside from making these tools easily accessible (via both Docker Hub and GitHub) we have minted a DOI to give this artifact a permanent unique identifier.
