Kind of badge applying for: reusable.
Reason: 
1. The symbolic execution framework is stable.
2. The benchmarks are collected from diverse sources.
3. Most of the deterministic experimental data can be reproduced (the non-deterministic points, e.g., the execution time and the number of finished tests within a given time, rely on the computing power of the machine).
