We provide our analyses as a set of Boa programs located in the src/ directory
and have the extension *.boa.
Note that each file is a separate analysis, and they share some amount of code
for convenience and output-consistency reasons.

In general, running one of the analyses on the 2015 GitHub dataset will
result in the exact same output as provided with the exception that some
debugging-related output and the order of the resulting output file may be
different.

There are two options to run the Boa analyses:
1. (Recommended) Use the http://boa.cs.iastate.edu website.
	a. Sign up for an account on this website.

	b. Log in once the account is created.

	c. Click "Run Examples" to go to the Boa program editor.

	d. Copy/paste the contents of ONE of the code files in the src/ directory
	into the text box.

	e. Scroll to bottom and choose the dataset to use.
		i. Our work used the "2015 September/GitHub" dataset.
		ii. Note that the "Small" datasets should be used for testing.

	f. Click "Run Program" and wait for it to complete.
		i. On large datasets, this may take up to 2.5 hours depending on server.
		ii. Small datasets take around 3 to 15 minutes.

		The program will be compiled and executed automatically, as detailed at
		the bottom of the webpage. A status of "Running" means it is compiling
		or running and "Finished" means that stage has successfully completed.

		A status of "Error" means something went wrong at one of the stages, and
		should not occur for any of the provided analyses.

	g. Click "Download Job Output" at the top of the page to download the raw
	output data.


2. Set up the Boa compiler (See: https://github.com/boalang/compiler) and run
the analyses through that.
NOTE: This does not include the project dataset we used. For that please use #1.
