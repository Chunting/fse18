## Badge: Reusable
![**Reusable**](doc/images/reusable.jpg)
- ReproDroid simplifies the benchmarking process for Android app analysis tools. Thereby, it is useful for studies in this field.
- The new benchmark cases that are part of ReproDroid extend the existing and often used benchmark DroidBench.
- The tools shipped with ReproDroid can be used in different contexts, e.g. to benchmark, run or combine Android app analysis tools.

Additionally:
- Our artifact is available on github: [https://foellix.github.io/ReproDroid](https://foellix.github.io/ReproDroid/)
- Detailed tutorials on how to use the involved tools can be obtained online: [https://github.com/FoelliX/BREW/wiki](https://github.com/FoelliX/BREW/wiki)
- The artifact may be used on the basis of a compiled executable or be compiled from its source code
- The involved [AQL-System](https://foellix.github.io/AQL-System) can be reused in other projects as a library e.g. via Maven

For these reasons we apply for the *Reusable* badge.
